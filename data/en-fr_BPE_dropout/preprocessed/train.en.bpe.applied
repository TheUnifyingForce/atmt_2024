I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s going to rain .
I &apos;ll tell my d@@ ad !

we are not rich .
A@@ to@@ mi@@ c en@@ er@@ g@@ y can be used for pe@@ ac@@ eful ends .
I will go if you go .

there are only 1@@ 0 min@@ u@@ t@@ es left until the end of the le@@ s@@ son .
Sami has a ri@@ de .

I want you to remember this mo@@ ment .

Sami &apos;s pl@@ an@@ e ha@@ sn &apos;t even ta@@ ken off .

I &apos;m not ready for this .
I ag@@ ree with what you say to some ex@@ t@@ ent .
he put the k@@ ey in the lo@@ ck .

I want you to have a job that you love .

I still don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about .
Tom was like a brother to me .
I don &apos;t want to play with you any more .

why can &apos;t I love them bot@@ h ?
did you know &quot; cre@@ du@@ l@@ ous &quot; is not in the di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary ?
I would like to learn to speak English with con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence .

I loo@@ ked , but I didn &apos;t see anything .
all of them say so , but I believe n@@ one of them .
the her@@ o@@ in isn &apos;t a good thing , stay away from it !
I &apos;m ce@@ le@@ br@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I par@@ ked the car .
w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver you do , don &apos;t sm@@ ile .
it would be better for bot@@ h of us not to see each other anymore .
no one could sol@@ ve the pu@@ z@@ z@@ le .
wo@@ men are ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally wea@@ k@@ er than men .
I feel like such an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .

I was spea@@ king to you .

sol@@ der@@ ing S@@ M@@ T comp@@ on@@ ents re@@ qu@@ i@@ res a bit more ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence than sol@@ der@@ ing thr@@ ough @-@ ho@@ le comp@@ on@@ ents .
I asked my teacher what I should do next .
English is my fav@@ or@@ ite su@@ b@@ je@@ ct in hi@@ gh school .
it would be better if you work this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
if for some re@@ as@@ on that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami sle@@ pt in his t@@ ent .
the re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant we went to wasn &apos;t as ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve as I expe@@ cted it to be .
they app@@ o@@ in@@ ted him as a di@@ re@@ ctor .
al@@ most everything has been im@@ pro@@ ved .
I really like this one .
we found one lar@@ ge f@@ oo@@ t@@ pr@@ int and a cou@@ p@@ le of differ@@ ent si@@ ze sm@@ al@@ l@@ er f@@ oo@@ t@@ pr@@ in@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sen@@ se ?
they were ta@@ ken pri@@ s@@ on@@ er .
what is the tal@@ le@@ st m@@ oun@@ tain in E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe ?
Tom lost his gl@@ as@@ ses some@@ where in the gar@@ d@@ en .
he has been to Fr@@ ance .
you can take wh@@ ic@@ h@@ ever ro@@ ad you like .
S@@ ally re@@ called the days when her gr@@ and@@ m@@ a was str@@ ong and heal@@ th@@ y .
why don &apos;t you ask M@@ r W@@ h@@ ite ?
try to be more p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ al from now on .
when I ru@@ n , I get s@@ we@@ at@@ y .
I have to go .
have you ever had a lo@@ ver who was never in the way ?
I &apos;ve already f@@ illed out the for@@ m .
br@@ ing an u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a without for@@ getting .
I &apos;d pre@@ f@@ er to di@@ e ra@@ ther than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like mat@@ h .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to talk about his life in the U@@ n@@ ited S@@ t@@ at@@ es .
she turned her e@@ yes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be f@@ ine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts , do you ?
Tom bu@@ r@@ st out la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing .
I can not af@@ for@@ d to buy a used car .
we ca@@ u@@ ght him red @-@ han@@ ded .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten min@@ u@@ t@@ es , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for pa@@ ti@@ ence .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ pl@@ ac@@ e@@ ment for him .
it &apos;s cal@@ m .
she was h@@ it by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same de@@ c@@ is@@ ion I &apos;m ma@@ king if he were in my sho@@ es .
I have a lar@@ ge be@@ d@@ room .
let the cat out .
I fin@@ ally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts about the way Tom be@@ ha@@ ves .
we &apos;re not inv@@ ited .
you need to f@@ il@@ ter the ou@@ t@@ put of this comm@@ and in or@@ der to di@@ sp@@ l@@ ay only the l@@ in@@ es with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; in@@ side .
he has a d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter who is very pre@@ tt@@ y .
don &apos;t th@@ row the ball ne@@ ar the windo@@ ws .
the E@@ ar@@ th is like a ball with a lar@@ ge ma@@ g@@ ne@@ t in@@ side .
that &apos;s just what I nee@@ ded .
promis@@ e me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want f@@ ur@@ ther in@@ for@@ ma@@ tion .
I could har@@ d@@ ly en@@ du@@ re the p@@ ain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I ca@@ u@@ ght a beautiful bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly .
French was the language of di@@ p@@ lo@@ m@@ ac@@ y .
I can &apos;t tell you how ang@@ ry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you ha@@ te ?
how much is your hou@@ r@@ ly pay ?
how could I li@@ e to you ?
he was a F@@ ren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his ac@@ c@@ ent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll resp@@ on@@ d .
as my father and my gr@@ and@@ father have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of k@@ i@@ ds in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married si@@ x times .
my father does not eat much fr@@ u@@ it .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ re@@ gu@@ la@@ r con@@ j@@ u@@ ga@@ tion in all langu@@ ages .
do you want me to re@@ pe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ ere bu@@ il@@ ding .
have you already e@@ at@@ en ?
it &apos;s really a@@ we@@ some .
he always ta@@ kes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true war@@ ri@@ or .
Tom nee@@ ds lo@@ ts of cou@@ r@@ age and per@@ se@@ ver@@ ance because he has to pay at@@ ten@@ tion to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve c@@ ost a for@@ tun@@ e .
th@@ ank you for inv@@ iting me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thin@@ king .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who b@@ ar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is s@@ il@@ ent and wa@@ gs its ta@@ il .
what did you just say ?
they make a great t@@ ea@@ m .
the se@@ par@@ a@@ ti@@ st@@ s think that I &apos;m k@@ i@@ d@@ ding .
the b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am ap@@ pl@@ ying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
I use the I@@ n@@ ter@@ ne@@ t as a re@@ s@@ ou@@ r@@ ce for my re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch .
he said he was po@@ or .
she thin@@ ks about him all the time .
he has his o@@ wn room .
I don &apos;t know who el@@ se to turn to for help .
this d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing took me fi@@ ve min@@ u@@ t@@ es , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your ru@@ les .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the ne@@ ws cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re wa@@ st@@ ing time .
what did you get h@@ it with ?
car@@ s are ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve .
they were not im@@ pres@@ sed .
to tell the truth , I d@@ ro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his per@@ mis@@ si@@ on .
he is Jap@@ an@@ ese to the b@@ one .
we go@@ tt@@ a have all the d@@ at@@ a in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an ex@@ pen@@ si@@ ve en@@ g@@ ag@@ e@@ ment r@@ ing .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my o@@ wn place .
you know what you must do .
he is tw@@ ice as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the d@@ ate yourself .
there is no hope .
cu@@ t that out !
I have to put my sho@@ es on .
Tom is an ar@@ ch@@ it@@ e@@ ct , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the war@@ ri@@ or .
you are not the only one resp@@ on@@ sible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to tra@@ v@@ el with only one su@@ it@@ c@@ ase .
you &apos;re wa@@ st@@ ing bot@@ h of our time .
early ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers used the star@@ s for na@@ vi@@ ga@@ tion .

brea@@ k@@ fast is ser@@ ved .
this is il@@ le@@ g@@ al .
I &apos;m not in the m@@ ood to go for a wal@@ k .

Mary wants to brea@@ st@@ fe@@ ed her b@@ ab@@ y , but she &apos;s not ma@@ king enough mil@@ k .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cu@@ re for lon@@ el@@ in@@ ess ?

parents must pro@@ vi@@ de their children with pro@@ p@@ er f@@ ood and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t be@@ at about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little lon@@ ger ?

I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t re@@ s@@ ist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .

how did you get into our room ?
we had to le@@ s@@ s@@ en the im@@ p@@ act of the er@@ ra@@ ti@@ c sup@@ p@@ li@@ es .

we cannot ru@@ le out the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty that ci@@ vi@@ l wa@@ r will brea@@ k out in that country .
I called him , but a girl ans@@ w@@ ered the phone .

do you mind if I turn down the T@@ V ?
I t@@ ried that .
Tom went to my room .
why are you busy today ?
when he r@@ an into difficul@@ ti@@ es , he asked his parents for help .
where did you learn this ?
do you have a ti@@ ck@@ et ?
I go to the par@@ k .

his wi@@ fe op@@ ened the door for him .

that made me very sa@@ d .
I don &apos;t have time to go to the mo@@ vi@@ es .
I want to pay with a che@@ ck .

bir@@ ds have sh@@ ar@@ p vis@@ ion .
who is Tom ?
Mary took the c@@ oo@@ k@@ i@@ es out of the o@@ ven .
he doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
he is something of a ce@@ le@@ br@@ ity .
life is a my@@ st@@ er@@ y to be li@@ ved , not a problem to be sol@@ ved .
I won &apos;t be able to stop .
I don &apos;t know the the@@ at@@ er play , but I know the au@@ th@@ or well .

I must have g@@ one p@@ ast the sta@@ tion while I was ta@@ king a na@@ p .
I for@@ got that you &apos;re Tom &apos;s best friend .
the dis@@ cre@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ y be@@ tw@@ e@@ en the stor@@ i@@ es of the two par@@ ti@@ es inv@@ ol@@ ved in the acci@@ dent was so great that the au@@ th@@ or@@ i@@ ti@@ es had a hard time deci@@ ding which side was tel@@ ling the truth .

there is a cat .
be car@@ eful !
I love your son .

his ni@@ e@@ ce is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive and mat@@ ure for her age .
you do like li@@ ving dang@@ er@@ ous@@ ly .
sp@@ r@@ ing has re@@ turned . the E@@ ar@@ th is like a child that knows po@@ e@@ ms .
what did I do wrong ?
W@@ i@@ pe your t@@ ears .
it took me more than two hours to tr@@ ans@@ late a few p@@ ages of English .
it &apos;s getting har@@ der for me to con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not c@@ rea@@ tive .
the books were so v@@ al@@ u@@ able that they were h@@ and@@ led with the gre@@ at@@ est care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we b@@ ar@@ ked up the wrong t@@ ree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t star@@ t all this .
I w@@ ish you could have come with me .
as a matter of f@@ act , all great dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ers have been re@@ gar@@ ded as d@@ rea@@ m@@ ers .
th@@ ank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
I promis@@ e that you won &apos;t be dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted .
can you dri@@ ve man@@ u@@ al ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I me@@ s@@ sed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a c@@ ha@@ in smo@@ k@@ er .
P@@ eas@@ an@@ ts often have a se@@ con@@ d@@ ary ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity to au@@ g@@ ment their in@@ come .
our p@@ as@@ sp@@ or@@ ts were can@@ c@@ el@@ led .
medi@@ c@@ ine should be out of the way of children .
that word des@@ cri@@ b@@ es it per@@ fe@@ ct@@ ly .
he wor@@ ks for her .
help me out here .
where do you live in T@@ ur@@ k@@ ey ?
why are you so c@@ lu@@ m@@ s@@ y ?
help me .
don &apos;t stay here .
the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or &apos;s dog is always b@@ ar@@ king .
I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il party .
Tom has ag@@ re@@ ed to help us .
I &apos;m sup@@ er hun@@ g@@ ry .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those proble@@ ms .
it &apos;s my fa@@ ul@@ t !
if the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation doesn &apos;t im@@ pro@@ ve , I &apos;ll be ob@@ li@@ g@@ ed to take me@@ as@@ u@@ res .
I have an u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a in my car .
wh@@ ose sho@@ es are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ e@@ f .
do you know where he went ?
the be@@ ar is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ c@@ ase to your room , si@@ r .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door nee@@ ds another co@@ at of pain@@ t .
I told you so !
he always went f@@ is@@ h@@ ing on the ri@@ ver when he was young .
he has three s@@ ons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to im@@ pro@@ ve your S@@ p@@ an@@ ish , you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have come to Ch@@ ile .
I know you like to tra@@ v@@ el .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this ca@@ ke for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this su@@ mmer we &apos;ll go to the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in@@ s and to the se@@ a .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he a@@ ven@@ g@@ ed the m@@ ur@@ der of his father .
my watch l@@ os@@ es ten min@@ u@@ t@@ es a day .
he is comple@@ t@@ ely be@@ so@@ t@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot ou@@ t@@ side that I want to sp@@ end all day in my a@@ ir con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed house .
I was f@@ al@@ sel@@ y ac@@ c@@ used .
he didn &apos;t know how to ex@@ pre@@ ss himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was k@@ illed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a hea@@ d@@ ac@@ he , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ hea@@ d of sch@@ e@@ du@@ le .
Tom r@@ ar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ k@@ er .
when we look at other pl@@ ac@@ es in the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se , it could very well be that p@@ ho@@ t@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ the@@ ti@@ c life is the ex@@ ce@@ p@@ tion .
it &apos;s true that it would be eas@@ i@@ er for stud@@ ents if there were only one sin@@ g@@ le S@@ p@@ an@@ ish di@@ al@@ e@@ ct , but that &apos;s qu@@ ite far from being the c@@ ase .
I won &apos;t ru@@ n away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter ?
you must take your parents adv@@ ice ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
I haven &apos;t told the k@@ i@@ ds yet that we &apos;re getting di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
let me car@@ ry it for you .

I gave my brother a di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary .

she &apos;s well st@@ ac@@ ked .
Sami thin@@ ks he did very well in the ex@@ am .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my ple@@ as@@ u@@ res is wat@@ ching T@@ V .
we need to get out of here .
were there any star@@ s in the sk@@ y ?

E@@ ar@@ ning our cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers con@@ fi@@ d@@ ence and resp@@ e@@ ct is this fir@@ m &apos;s ob@@ je@@ c@@ tive .

when I en@@ ter@@ ed the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , she was ma@@ king ch@@ ic@@ ken c@@ ur@@ ry with ri@@ ce .
I am thr@@ ough with my work .
who is the man s@@ it@@ ting in the cor@@ ner ?
my parents har@@ d@@ ly ever p@@ un@@ ished me for anything .
we must ab@@ an@@ don shi@@ p .
the off@@ ic@@ i@@ al we di@@ sch@@ ar@@ g@@ ed of his ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
his le@@ gs are long .
Mary was lu@@ ck@@ y to find her ke@@ ys .
it beg@@ an to s@@ now .
why are you doing that today ?
who were you talking to ?
this is a pres@@ ent for you .
what &apos;s the fun in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may cho@@ ose wh@@ ic@@ h@@ ever you want .
I never tal@@ ked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this con@@ cer@@ t was a@@ we@@ some .
what is life without the ra@@ di@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ di@@ sp@@ u@@ t@@ able f@@ act that A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans are , as A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans , the most self @-@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous people in the world , and the most ad@@ di@@ cted to the belie@@ f that the other na@@ tions of the ear@@ th are in a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ac@@ y to under@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ e them .
we &apos;re s@@ un@@ k .
do not under@@ est@@ im@@ ate my po@@ wer .
I can &apos;t play ten@@ n@@ is as well as I used to .
this is fu@@ c@@ ked up .
I be@@ t you &apos;re right .
have some co@@ ffe@@ e .
un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ ely , they are very po@@ or@@ ly e@@ du@@ c@@ ated people .
the wr@@ it@@ er does not always pres@@ ent life as it is .
language and cu@@ l@@ ture can &apos;t be se@@ par@@ ated .
nobody car@@ es for me .
there is a ta@@ x@@ i st@@ and ne@@ ar the sta@@ tion .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ at@@ r@@ a &apos;s n@@ ose had been sh@@ or@@ ter , the hi@@ story of the world would be differ@@ ent .
his room was small but c@@ le@@ an , and the f@@ ood was good .
his slee@@ ve tou@@ ch@@ ed the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a s@@ ac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
S@@ m@@ ith has sp@@ ent years stud@@ ying the e@@ ffe@@ c@@ ts of sleep and sleep l@@ oss on me@@ mor@@ y and lear@@ ning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .
we want to help .
you don &apos;t need to wor@@ ry anymore .
where is your father ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise .
the cat ru@@ ined my so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re less than hal@@ f@@ way to the to@@ p of the m@@ oun@@ tain . are you already tired ?
con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ la@@ tions !
I &apos;m re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly feel@@ ing down in the du@@ mp@@ s .
they &apos;re all on v@@ ac@@ ation .
if you can , come with us .
I tr@@ ust Tom &apos;s j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
I go home .
I &apos;ve been asked to be@@ come the man@@ ag@@ er .
a c@@ row@@ d was ga@@ th@@ er@@ ing around him .
I &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
she di@@ ed of tu@@ b@@ er@@ cu@@ l@@ os@@ is .
it was your mista@@ ke .
it was very ru@@ de of you to say a thing like that .
these t@@ ex@@ ts were wr@@ it@@ ten in H@@ e@@ b@@ re@@ w , not in A@@ ra@@ ma@@ ic .
you look fa@@ mi@@ li@@ ar . do I know you ?
we must do it again .
she made a t@@ our of A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a , st@@ op@@ ping in si@@ x ci@@ ti@@ es .
M@@ r@@ . Y@@ oun@@ g w@@ is@@ h@@ es his son would study har@@ der .
I have no fa@@ ul@@ ts .
please si@@ g@@ n here .
I need a little help here .
you &apos;re going to have to pay for the re@@ pa@@ ir .
take things as they are .
it is ra@@ in@@ ing now .

so ta@@ st@@ y !
I &apos;ve never had proble@@ ms before .
I prob@@ ab@@ ly should have said something .
don &apos;t mi@@ x the di@@ sh@@ clo@@ th@@ s with the ser@@ vi@@ e@@ tt@@ es .
I thought he would be up@@ s@@ et .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the sh@@ or@@ t@@ est @-@ li@@ ved pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ ons there is .
the mil@@ k is s@@ our .
does anyone speak English ?
he app@@ e@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be im@@ pos@@ sible to get a comple@@ t@@ ely er@@ r@@ or @-@ free cor@@ p@@ us du@@ e to the n@@ at@@ ure of this kind of col@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ a@@ tive e@@ f@@ for@@ t . H@@ o@@ we@@ ver , if we en@@ cou@@ r@@ age me@@ mb@@ ers to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te sen@@ ten@@ ces in their o@@ wn langu@@ ages ra@@ ther than ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent in langu@@ ages they are lear@@ ning , we might be able to min@@ im@@ i@@ ze er@@ r@@ or@@ s .
that is the wor@@ st thing you can do !
has he got any ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence of f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing ?
Tom knows the c@@ ity very well .
you could &apos;ve ru@@ ined everything .
because they &apos;re wat@@ ching te@@ le@@ vis@@ ion .
we &apos;ve just fin@@ ished brea@@ k@@ fast .

I was married .

it go@@ es without sa@@ ying that h@@ on@@ est@@ y is the k@@ ey to su@@ cc@@ ess .

Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary everything .
my wi@@ fe is si@@ x mon@@ th@@ s pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant with our first son .

he li@@ ed about his age .
there is something I must know .

I &apos;m tired of e@@ ating at the school ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ i@@ a .
su@@ mmer is coming to an end .
will you leave a me@@ s@@ s@@ age ?
how lon@@ ely and hel@@ ple@@ ss she must feel left all by her@@ self !
as the first p@@ ack e@@ mer@@ g@@ es , the sp@@ e@@ ct@@ at@@ or@@ s take pic@@ tu@@ res with their ca@@ mer@@ as and mo@@ b@@ ile ph@@ on@@ es .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything el@@ se to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I nee@@ ded to eat less can@@ dy .
I didn &apos;t s@@ c@@ rea@@ m .
I gu@@ ess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that c@@ lea@@ r , but that &apos;s the only way I can ex@@ pl@@ ain it .
she will be able to ans@@ wer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy hou@@ ses .
it &apos;s in the gar@@ age .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a so@@ lu@@ tion .
he &apos;s g@@ one into hi@@ ding .
M@@ r B@@ ro@@ wn is our fin@@ an@@ ci@@ al ad@@ vis@@ er .
I am an ar@@ ti@@ st .
you should buy her new to@@ ys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .
he &apos;s tri@@ p@@ ping b@@ al@@ ls .
she is nothing to him .
J@@ u@@ li@@ an w@@ ears r@@ ound gl@@ as@@ ses like J@@ o@@ h@@ n L@@ en@@ n@@ on &apos;s .
did you get fir@@ ed from your last job ?
I like f@@ un@@ n@@ y gu@@ ys .
I us@@ u@@ ally get up at e@@ ight .

we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it ra@@ in@@ s .
is it pos@@ sible to de@@ ter@@ mine the di@@ a@@ me@@ ter from the c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ f@@ er@@ ence ?
do you plan to work until 1@@ 0 : 0@@ 0 ?
and on s@@ un@@ n@@ y days all the pi@@ ge@@ ons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feel@@ ing O@@ K ?
Sami re@@ se@@ mb@@ les the s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct .

we believe in a better world .
is she still sin@@ g@@ le ?
I didn &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y the party at all .
she a@@ im@@ ed at the t@@ ar@@ get .
we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting d@@ ar@@ k ou@@ t@@ side .
I can &apos;t read A@@ r@@ ab@@ ic s@@ cri@@ pt .
they ha@@ ted Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t ag@@ ree with the the@@ or@@ y that one should learn L@@ at@@ in in or@@ der to better understand English .
I &apos;m being ser@@ i@@ ous !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need pro@@ of .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .
please pic@@ k me up by car in fr@@ on@@ t of the ho@@ te@@ l .
who gave you your n@@ ic@@ k@@ name ?
under n@@ or@@ ma@@ l con@@ di@@ tions , the bo@@ il@@ ing po@@ int of water is 1@@ 0@@ 0 de@@ gre@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us .
we &apos;re doing well .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
you took my app@@ e@@ ti@@ te away .
this is the first time that I &apos;ve e@@ at@@ en in an I@@ tal@@ i@@ an pi@@ z@@ z@@ er@@ i@@ a .
no one can d@@ en@@ y the f@@ act .
ab@@ o@@ ve all things , we must not be sel@@ f@@ ish .
I have difficul@@ ty con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ating .
he is always d@@ w@@ el@@ ling on the ple@@ as@@ u@@ res of the p@@ ast .
I &apos;ll stay inv@@ ol@@ ved .
this happened pri@@ or to re@@ ce@@ i@@ ving your letter .
Tom likes te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ g@@ y .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is b@@ lu@@ e .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment is re@@ des@@ ig@@ ning the c@@ ur@@ ren@@ c@@ y to try and cu@@ t down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ iting .
ac@@ id rain is not a n@@ at@@ ur@@ al ph@@ en@@ o@@ m@@ en@@ on .
we should pre@@ ser@@ ve the beauti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
I can get us there more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ mp@@ et .
I think that f@@ act is very im@@ por@@ t@@ ant .
I don &apos;t know what I o@@ we you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 3@@ 0 .
car@@ ry these books back to the boo@@ k@@ sh@@ el@@ f .
have a nice tri@@ p .
the train is lea@@ ving right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to l@@ ose my job .
you like cat@@ s , don &apos;t you ?
that has nothing to do with this .
is this fa@@ ke ?
my father always rea@@ ds the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er before brea@@ k@@ fast .
Tom told me he &apos;d already e@@ at@@ en .
I &apos;ll do w@@ ha@@ te@@ ver you want .
she pla@@ ys the f@@ lu@@ te .
they look so cu@@ te together .
Tom wi@@ ped his gl@@ as@@ ses .
it really h@@ its the na@@ il on the hea@@ d .
she has inter@@ na@@ tion@@ al re@@ no@@ wn as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom s@@ li@@ p and f@@ all .
take your co@@ at off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s wor@@ th li@@ es not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am a@@ w@@ k@@ ward with nu@@ mb@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I bu@@ il@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ou@@ se by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the con@@ cer@@ t because he had to work .
he &apos;s bro@@ ke .
she is far from h@@ on@@ est .
there are good gr@@ oun@@ ds for the vi@@ e@@ w that P@@ ar@@ is was the s@@ cen@@ e of f@@ re@@ qu@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ vo@@ lu@@ tion of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f ou@@ t@@ l@@ ine of the plan .
if I were you , I would ig@@ n@@ or@@ e it .
there are f@@ our se@@ as@@ ons in this country .
I want a d@@ on@@ u@@ t .
I &apos;m in@@ cre@@ di@@ b@@ ly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the s@@ il@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
everyone looks wor@@ ried .
I ob@@ je@@ ct to her going there alone .
you &apos;re al@@ most right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as so@@ on as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich &quot; B@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I w@@ ish you had come with us .
this l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ y is where we study every day .
I like these ha@@ ts .
we &apos;ll deci@@ de lat@@ er .
last win@@ ter , I went sk@@ i@@ ing in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with L@@ a@@ y@@ l@@ a .
this so@@ f@@ a can se@@ at three people eas@@ ily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t expe@@ ct anyone to help you .
is the dog swi@@ mm@@ ing ?
please pre@@ p@@ are for the tri@@ p .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel u@@ ne@@ as@@ y without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things c@@ lea@@ r .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much cho@@ ice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hur@@ t .
are you married or sin@@ g@@ le ? do you live alone or are you in a re@@ la@@ tion@@ shi@@ p ?
the sk@@ y is c@@ lea@@ r . not a cl@@ ou@@ d in si@@ ght .
I &apos;m not st@@ op@@ ping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing s@@ it@@ ting down is not all that bad .
che@@ ck these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly .
Tom is as t@@ all as any stu@@ dent in his cl@@ ass is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
gu@@ ess what happened to me .
your fu@@ ture beg@@ in@@ s today .
I think it &apos;s dang@@ er@@ ous for children to swi@@ m in this la@@ ke .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s slee@@ ping .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ary .
an en@@ or@@ m@@ ous sp@@ ace sta@@ tion or@@ i@@ b@@ iting around J@@ up@@ it@@ er o@@ ver@@ loo@@ ked the ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w st@@ ri@@ p@@ es of the g@@ as gi@@ ant .
the in@@ j@@ ured were re@@ mo@@ ved from the s@@ cen@@ e .
the train is arri@@ ving !
I &apos;ll pay you .
she was sick .
I have a co@@ at , but I have no h@@ at .
I know the cu@@ re for what a@@ il@@ s you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the re@@ su@@ l@@ t .
do not be sh@@ y . your pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less cor@@ re@@ ct .
the a@@ ir was hu@@ m@@ id and lu@@ ke@@ war@@ m .
of cou@@ r@@ se , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it al@@ most s@@ car@@ ed me not to see you on@@ l@@ ine for a wh@@ o@@ le day .
she is as f@@ l@@ at as a p@@ an@@ ca@@ ke .
this ar@@ ti@@ cle is more interest@@ ing than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you h@@ it your children ?
beau@@ ty ple@@ as@@ es the e@@ yes , k@@ in@@ d@@ ness en@@ ch@@ an@@ ts the s@@ ou@@ l .
our plan went wrong from the beg@@ in@@ ning .
I don &apos;t en@@ jo@@ y teac@@ h@@ ing children to swi@@ m when their parents are around .
this is one of the re@@ as@@ ons why I love T@@ at@@ o@@ e@@ b@@ a .
do you still need te@@ a ?
a child should not get more sp@@ en@@ ding money than is ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ary .
the pi@@ z@@ z@@ a is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surpri@@ sed by his su@@ dd@@ en app@@ ear@@ ance .
no one could d@@ en@@ y this .
Tom r@@ an out of mat@@ ch@@ es so he couldn &apos;t light the fi@@ re .
I &apos;ve never been to a pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al b@@ as@@ e@@ ball ga@@ me .
Tom &apos;s in@@ no@@ c@@ ent .
everyone ga@@ th@@ ered together for the pic@@ ture .
I &apos;d like to get away from B@@ os@@ ton for a few days .
Tom is je@@ al@@ ous .
please re@@ f@@ er to the tou@@ ri@@ st in@@ for@@ ma@@ tion off@@ ice .
don &apos;t leave the fr@@ on@@ t door op@@ en .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be coming .
it was N@@ an@@ c@@ y where M@@ a@@ x was sup@@ pos@@ ed to meet P@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ a .
Tom and Mary wa@@ sh@@ ed the di@@ sh@@ es together .
Tom is wat@@ ching .
be@@ si@@ d@@ es the rain , we ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ced hea@@ v@@ y win@@ ds .
he com@@ es from a small but we@@ al@@ th@@ y to@@ wn .
I am ga@@ me !
Tom seems to be in love .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the se@@ ven s@@ ac@@ ra@@ m@@ ents .
he asked me if I wanted to go ab@@ ro@@ ad .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ac@@ h@@ ing you .
does Tom still re@@ ly on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of you@@ rs .
I just wanted cl@@ ar@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ation .
let &apos;s wor@@ ry about that lat@@ er .
he hur@@ t his fin@@ ger with a nee@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to re@@ s@@ cu@@ e him .
I fi@@ g@@ ured out a way to make more money .
this job gi@@ ves me the hu@@ m@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ e@@ c@@ y came true .
I ha@@ te people who have feel@@ ings .
have a nice wee@@ k@@ end !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; stor@@ i@@ es . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
not all gen@@ i@@ us@@ es are en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ ers , but all en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ ers are gen@@ i@@ us@@ es . the s@@ et of all en@@ g@@ in@@ e@@ ers is th@@ us an , un@@ for@@ tun@@ at@@ ely pro@@ p@@ er , su@@ b@@ s@@ et of all gen@@ i@@ us@@ es .
I don &apos;t think anyone thin@@ ks you &apos;re cra@@ zy .
Tom ig@@ n@@ or@@ ed our adv@@ ice .
we will be done in at most an h@@ our .
I see her la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing and jo@@ king with them .
he was star@@ ing at her c@@ lea@@ v@@ age .
we &apos;re fin@@ ished already .
we &apos;re un@@ re@@ l@@ ated .
it &apos;s mis@@ le@@ ad@@ ing .
the only one who can sol@@ ve this problem is you .
what a beautiful ra@@ in@@ bo@@ w !
you &apos;re a n@@ er@@ v@@ ous w@@ re@@ ck .
are you good at kee@@ ping se@@ cre@@ ts ?
try hard to ho@@ ld it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re sa@@ ying ?
you don &apos;t s@@ ound enti@@ re@@ ly con@@ v@@ in@@ ced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the d@@ ar@@ k .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his co@@ at and left .
it &apos;s a qu@@ ar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
she was on the s@@ cen@@ e of the cri@@ me .
it makes no fu@@ c@@ king sen@@ se .
his e@@ yes were sm@@ il@@ ing be@@ h@@ ind his gl@@ as@@ ses .
miss S@@ a@@ to is the pre@@ si@@ dent &apos;s new se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .
when is something ar@@ t ?
please make fi@@ ve co@@ pi@@ es of this do@@ cu@@ ment .
do you have your p@@ il@@ ls ?

don &apos;t s@@ ass me .
I want to take you to dinner .
I don &apos;t know when the meeting started , but it started at le@@ ast th@@ ir@@ ty min@@ u@@ t@@ es ag@@ o .
it &apos;s not sup@@ pos@@ ed to happen .
he h@@ it me tw@@ ice .
help me , please .
I &apos;ve never go@@ tt@@ en a sp@@ ee@@ ding ti@@ ck@@ et .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a f@@ ish le@@ ap@@ ed out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than time .
are there any b@@ ag@@ s in this sho@@ p ?
hur@@ ry up , gir@@ ls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very ru@@ de .
he &apos;s pain@@ ting his house .
Tom looks like a fo@@ re@@ ig@@ ner .
I had two co@@ pi@@ es of the book .
I did it in a hur@@ ry .
please tell me which bu@@ s to take to go do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn .
tell me what you did on your ho@@ li@@ days .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
I &apos;ve lear@@ ned so much from my mista@@ kes , I &apos;m thin@@ king of ma@@ king a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten min@@ u@@ t@@ es s@@ low .
I am a stu@@ dent at O@@ x@@ for@@ d U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will s@@ now tomorrow .
you &apos;re too na@@ i@@ ve .
his be@@ ard was th@@ ic@@ k and red .
I won@@ der if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
that &apos;s interest@@ ing .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for mon@@ th@@ s .
what year were you bor@@ n ?
please d@@ ro@@ p in when you happen to be in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
he is ea@@ ger to please .
I didn &apos;t cat@@ ch your last name .
we &apos;re bot@@ h w@@ it@@ ne@@ s@@ ses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a b@@ ath .
you don &apos;t have per@@ mis@@ si@@ on to do that .
I don &apos;t need any re@@ st .
all took par@@ t in the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ a@@ tions .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the pa@@ ti@@ ent was di@@ sch@@ ar@@ g@@ ed from h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al .
do you think Tom can re@@ turn ?
I have no money to buy the di@@ c@@ tion@@ ary .
Sami re@@ f@@ used to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place el@@ se to go .
I had been stud@@ ying mus@@ ic in B@@ os@@ ton before I re@@ turned to Jap@@ an .
she vis@@ ited the old man in the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al every day but S@@ un@@ day .
she came to Jap@@ an for the p@@ ur@@ p@@ ose of stud@@ ying Jap@@ an@@ ese .
please take your time before deci@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ cted and im@@ pre@@ g@@ n@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who l@@ an@@ ded their f@@ l@@ ying sa@@ u@@ c@@ er in my b@@ ac@@ k@@ y@@ ard .
why did G@@ o@@ d cre@@ ate the un@@ i@@ ver@@ se ?
p@@ ass me the su@@ ga@@ r , please .
that was c@@ ool .
is this one of your c@@ rea@@ tions ?
there was a hea@@ v@@ y rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another acci@@ dent .
didn &apos;t I m@@ en@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having d@@ ou@@ b@@ ts .
they like English .
list@@ en to me , he said col@@ d@@ ly , my father was the king of K@@ a@@ k@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m tel@@ ling you the truth .
she wor@@ e a red bl@@ ou@@ se .
I sta@@ yed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ ft .
the to@@ wn was fu@@ ll of ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ity .
leave him alone .
I had no in@@ ten@@ tion of doing so .
the E@@ ar@@ th and S@@ u@@ n are just t@@ in@@ y do@@ ts am@@ ong the b@@ il@@ li@@ ons of star@@ s in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
I su@@ gg@@ est we go out for a drink .
ma@@ y@@ be you should just leave Tom alone .
do you re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze the man in this p@@ ho@@ to ?
I want to jo@@ in your t@@ ea@@ m .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the windo@@ w .
there is a ca@@ fe@@ ter@@ i@@ a in the un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cat@@ s .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tr@@ a bed .
you should take care of your@@ sel@@ ves .
be kind to little an@@ im@@ al@@ s .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ low@@ ing down my com@@ pu@@ ter .
my com@@ pu@@ ter cr@@ as@@ hed and now it won &apos;t star@@ t up .
when the des@@ i@@ re for le@@ is@@ ure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other ur@@ g@@ es , le@@ is@@ ure win@@ s .
we still have more than hal@@ f@@ way to go to get to the to@@ p of the m@@ oun@@ tain . are you really already ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st@@ ed ?
few stud@@ ents can read L@@ at@@ in .
how many hours a day do you sp@@ end in your off@@ ice ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I fin@@ ally found a use for this old thing .
I want to war@@ m myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bo@@ ther you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I ad@@ mi@@ re your de@@ ter@@ min@@ ation .
they all went to the re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
I &apos;m sure I can per@@ su@@ a@@ de Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay sin@@ g@@ le .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to su@@ mmer v@@ ac@@ ation .
I made a po@@ t ro@@ ast .
is she still sin@@ g@@ le ?
she is not as beautiful as her ol@@ der sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ e@@ su@@ s .
don &apos;t do@@ d@@ ge the question .
why does Tom want this in@@ for@@ ma@@ tion ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ c@@ ks get op@@ ened up to .
Tom gave me a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en e@@ g@@ gs .
you mis@@ underst@@ ood me .
I don &apos;t know e@@ i@@ ther of his bro@@ thers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will ho@@ ld tal@@ ks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to pro@@ te@@ ct you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the we@@ d@@ ding be hel@@ d ? &quot;
only a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le may get him out of it .
can I see your dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ se ?
this should sol@@ ve all your proble@@ ms .
the man reading a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er is his father .
I never drink be@@ er before l@@ un@@ ch .
did you have any lu@@ ck ?
I &apos;m a str@@ ang@@ er here .
someone th@@ re@@ w a ro@@ ck at him .
he k@@ is@@ sed me on the fo@@ re@@ hea@@ d .
M@@ ar@@ i@@ a didn &apos;t s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct that &quot; Tom , &quot; her p@@ en @-@ friend , with wh@@ om she had been cor@@ resp@@ on@@ ding for mon@@ th@@ s over the I@@ n@@ ter@@ ne@@ t and wh@@ om she se@@ cre@@ tly lo@@ ved , without ever having met him , was ac@@ tu@@ ally a sup@@ er @-@ in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interest@@ ed in ar@@ t ?
a dog sel@@ d@@ om b@@ it@@ es un@@ less it is at@@ t@@ ac@@ ked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ined that he was in@@ no@@ c@@ ent .
he is a man who is f@@ on@@ d of cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sh@@ oo@@ ting your big m@@ ou@@ th off .
he is very afraid of do@@ gs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is or@@ din@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look p@@ al@@ e as a gh@@ ost .
cat@@ ch you lat@@ er .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the k@@ i@@ ds ?
ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y is often re@@ gar@@ ded as difficult .
the ra@@ di@@ o doesn &apos;t work .
he di@@ ed fi@@ ve years ag@@ o .
I knew we should &apos;ve t@@ ried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ con@@ si@@ der the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not expe@@ ct him to fin@@ ish the t@@ ask in so sh@@ or@@ t a time .
the sp@@ ace b@@ ar is an al@@ ph@@ an@@ u@@ mer@@ ic@@ al ke@@ y@@ bo@@ ard &apos;s k@@ ey .
that job is im@@ pos@@ sible for me to do .
there is much su@@ ga@@ r in this bl@@ ack bo@@ x .
our mother had no cho@@ ice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ ver@@ s .
these two l@@ in@@ es cu@@ t ac@@ r@@ oss each other at right ang@@ les .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dre@@ s@@ ses .
I ha@@ te this ga@@ me .
he &apos;s s@@ mar@@ t , h@@ and@@ some and poli@@ te .
don &apos;t put all your e@@ g@@ gs in one b@@ as@@ k@@ et .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to ap@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze for the way I ac@@ ted last night .
may you be tou@@ ch@@ ed by H@@ is N@@ oo@@ d@@ ly A@@ p@@ pen@@ d@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re e@@ ating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .
she al@@ most fa@@ in@@ ted .
how much is the ex@@ pre@@ ss ?
my father isn &apos;t at home .
my book is not there .
only th@@ en did I re@@ ali@@ ze what he me@@ ant .
why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lo@@ ts of ph@@ on@@ es .
keep your e@@ y@@ e on the ball .
I bu@@ r@@ ned my h@@ and with an ir@@ on .
that &apos;s im@@ pos@@ sible .
we love our mother al@@ most without kno@@ w@@ ing it , without feel@@ ing it , as it is as n@@ at@@ ur@@ al as to live .
it s@@ car@@ ed me .
when I &apos;m hot , a gl@@ ass of c@@ ool water really re@@ f@@ re@@ sh@@ es me .
can you tell me where the ne@@ ar@@ est bu@@ s stop is ?
the st@@ e@@ w sm@@ el@@ ls de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous .
Tom tal@@ ks very fast .
please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hun@@ g@@ ry .
&quot; why is your room p@@ in@@ k , Tom ? &quot; &quot; O@@ h , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m lo@@ ved .
you still haven &apos;t fin@@ ished pa@@ ying for your wa@@ sh@@ ing m@@ ac@@ h@@ ine ?
there is a ro@@ ck in my sho@@ e .
this dog will pro@@ te@@ ct us .
Tom is a di@@ ve ma@@ ster .
I &apos;m going to learn Ger@@ man .
can I go to bed now ?

I &apos;d heard you &apos;d chang@@ ed .
I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions about what you did last wee@@ k@@ end .

the doctor ad@@ vis@@ ed me not to eat too much .
she got up at se@@ ven in the morning .
I w@@ ear a su@@ it , but not a ti@@ e .
we will e@@ mp@@ lo@@ y a man who can speak English .
the b@@ ab@@ y is slee@@ ping .
he asked questions at r@@ and@@ om .
that &apos;s too hard .
tell Tom what Mary told you .
I can &apos;t tell you what an h@@ on@@ or this is .
Tom dr@@ ank a gl@@ ass of water .
he took the w@@ ood and sa@@ w@@ ed it us@@ ing the saw .
B@@ i@@ ga@@ my is when you have one wi@@ fe too many .

I believe she &apos;s 4@@ 0 years old .
he was the first to help him .
can I get you something to drink ?
please give me a c@@ up of water .
you don &apos;t look very good .
I know Tom is in .
you must be fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly with your ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ s .

there are a few y@@ ac@@ h@@ ts on the cal@@ m se@@ a .
g@@ oo@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e !
my fa@@ ith in the next gen@@ er@@ ation is in@@ cre@@ as@@ ing .
how do we find out what we need to know ?
but go@@ dd@@ am@@ m@@ it where did I put those re@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge@@ able b@@ at@@ ter@@ i@@ es ?
I met Tom when I was th@@ ir@@ te@@ en .
I don &apos;t have any cho@@ ice .
most A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ ans are I@@ s@@ la@@ mi@@ st@@ s , some show it but o@@ thers will hi@@ de it .
I am hun@@ g@@ ry because I did not have brea@@ k@@ fast .
he will do his best to fin@@ ish it on time .
we don &apos;t care what he does .
now I &apos;m wi@@ de a@@ wa@@ ke .
we must re@@ f@@ le@@ ct on our fa@@ il@@ ure .
who is your fav@@ ou@@ r@@ ite Y@@ ou@@ T@@ u@@ b@@ er ?
his dog app@@ ear@@ ed su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly from be@@ h@@ ind the door .
I can &apos;t get al@@ ong with him .
my d@@ ad &apos;s name is Fr@@ it@@ z .
it &apos;s O@@ K with me .
it didn &apos;t work for me e@@ i@@ ther .
they saw us yesterday .
F@@ red took a li@@ king to J@@ an@@ e and they started see@@ ing each other .
Tom makes de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous c@@ oo@@ k@@ i@@ es .
I &apos;d like to use a sa@@ fe .
it could just be your i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ation .
and it la@@ st@@ ed until early morning .
who could b@@ la@@ me him ?
he wi@@ gg@@ led his to@@ es .
I found the love of my life .
do you want to s@@ it next to the windo@@ w ?
that was prob@@ ab@@ ly what in@@ f@@ lu@@ en@@ ced their de@@ c@@ is@@ ion .
the Ger@@ m@@ ans have won again .
are there any other op@@ tions ?
you don &apos;t know that .
they do it fa@@ ster than me .
b@@ ite your ton@@ gu@@ e .
I can &apos;t promis@@ e you anything .
we won &apos;t have enough time to do that before Tom ge@@ ts here .
Tom t@@ os@@ sed another lo@@ g on the fi@@ re .
I can re@@ place him .
I am still young .
they are .
I think I know what this is .
a h@@ en la@@ id an e@@ g@@ g in my cl@@ os@@ et .
the to@@ ma@@ to is a v@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ able , not a fr@@ u@@ it .
wh@@ er@@ ever Mary go@@ es , the sh@@ ee@@ p fol@@ lo@@ ws her .
please don &apos;t go home .
keep in mind that smo@@ king is not good for your heal@@ th .
this mo@@ vi@@ e is really s@@ c@@ ary .
it has been f@@ ine for a week .
he must find work .
I am sorry if I am bo@@ th@@ er@@ ing you .
I like wat@@ ching T@@ V .
we get app@@ li@@ ca@@ tions from every@@ where .
Tom asked Mary to s@@ wee@@ p the f@@ lo@@ or .
spea@@ king about love is ma@@ king love .
they will ag@@ ree on that .
you &apos;re dis@@ lo@@ y@@ al .
I don &apos;t know what your problem is .
what &apos;s your e @-@ ma@@ il ad@@ dress ?
Tom has what it ta@@ kes to be a good teacher .
she is very f@@ on@@ d of wr@@ iting po@@ e@@ ms .
I hope that you aren &apos;t afraid .
I l@@ ent Tom my ca@@ mer@@ a .
am I the only one ?
would you like to come ?
Tom is po@@ or , but he &apos;s happy .
our car is being re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ed at the au@@ to sho@@ p .
there was a par@@ a@@ de to mar@@ k the o@@ cc@@ as@@ ion .
who s@@ ent you ?
my son isn &apos;t the only one who en@@ jo@@ ys e@@ ating her c@@ oo@@ king .
I just need to be alone .
have you any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
they &apos;re too f@@ at .
I know that he &apos;s reading .
Tom di@@ ed a few days lat@@ er .
I won &apos;t come tomorrow .
I just don &apos;t want to believe it .
the sta@@ tion is three k@@ il@@ o@@ me@@ ters away from here .
don &apos;t ask questions , just come with me .
don &apos;t b@@ ra@@ ke su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly .
I won &apos;t be coming until f@@ our o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .
I bought this h@@ at when I was in B@@ os@@ ton .
I ag@@ ree with everything you just said .
what do you think of this red h@@ at ?
this is not about money .
your con@@ du@@ ct is per@@ fe@@ ct@@ ly le@@ g@@ al .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
my family isn &apos;t such a big family .
he &apos;s w@@ ear@@ ing sk@@ in@@ n@@ y je@@ ans and a t@@ ank to@@ p .
I don &apos;t know how Tom got my phone nu@@ mber .
we w@@ er@@ en &apos;t all that busy .

she looks very happy .
the end of the er@@ a of pe@@ t@@ ro@@ le@@ u@@ m is in si@@ ght .
what does a w@@ ol@@ f eat ?
I want ven@@ ge@@ ance .
that is not what I me@@ ant to say .
you &apos;re fir@@ ed .
Tom can swi@@ m no more than a st@@ one can .
do we need a P@@ l@@ an B ?
is there something I can do for you ?
I think Tom has been very lu@@ ck@@ y .
he gave the im@@ pres@@ si@@ on of having much money .
it &apos;s st@@ able because all the r@@ oo@@ ts of this e@@ qu@@ ation are ne@@ ga@@ tive .
could you please fi@@ x this ?
we speak English in cl@@ ass .
happy bir@@ th@@ day !

I will act on your adv@@ ice .
don &apos;t tou@@ ch my stu@@ f@@ f .

Tom is your un@@ cle .
I still have another sister .
&quot; what &apos;s happ@@ en@@ ing ? , &quot; m@@ ur@@ m@@ ured a vo@@ ice from the other end of the room .
I &apos;m good at pla@@ ying the pi@@ an@@ o .
we &apos;re in ch@@ ar@@ ge .
you &apos;re the only one who underst@@ an@@ ds me .
how would you de@@ f@@ ine &quot; happ@@ in@@ ess &quot; ?
I have not more than three th@@ ous@@ and y@@ en .
I &apos;m not a per@@ fe@@ c@@ tion@@ ist .

I hope Tom la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed at your jo@@ kes .
men are bor@@ n and re@@ ma@@ in free and e@@ qu@@ al in ri@@ gh@@ ts .

it has been ra@@ in@@ ing since S@@ un@@ day .
I cannot af@@ for@@ d long v@@ ac@@ a@@ tions .
he has a will of st@@ eel .
Tom f@@ row@@ ned .
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job .
he was im@@ pres@@ sed .
that was s@@ we@@ et of you .
L@@ u@@ ck@@ ily the door was op@@ en .
I should &apos;ve war@@ ned you .
I want to k@@ ill you right now .

she is sin@@ g@@ ing the lat@@ est p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r s@@ on@@ gs .
the dog ni@@ p@@ ped at me .
that &apos;s a very old sa@@ ying .
M@@ a@@ y@@ u@@ k@@ o was tired to de@@ ath .
you must not think about your im@@ medi@@ ate pro@@ f@@ it only .
I still haven &apos;t e@@ at@@ en today .
he &apos;s a con@@ t@@ ro@@ l f@@ rea@@ k .
you &apos;ve often said so yourself .
you are not my mother .
she is qu@@ i@@ et .
on the first p@@ age of the se@@ con@@ d ch@@ ap@@ ter there are many new wor@@ ds .
don &apos;t speak un@@ less you &apos;re spo@@ ken to .

I &apos;m sure Tom doesn &apos;t think that .
you &apos;re lea@@ ving already ?
the poli@@ ce ca@@ u@@ ght the th@@ i@@ e@@ f .
C@@ en@@ tr@@ al P@@ ar@@ k is ne@@ ar where I work .
I don &apos;t need a lo@@ an anymore .
I think that he &apos;s prob@@ ab@@ ly not a bad boy .
I fin@@ ally found out what was wrong with my T@@ V .
we &apos;ve all done things we &apos;re as@@ ha@@ m@@ ed of .
it took a long time to br@@ ing him around to our po@@ int of vi@@ e@@ w .

Tom has a so@@ ft spo@@ t for Mary .
for@@ give Tom .
he pla@@ yed ten@@ n@@ is .
have you ever t@@ ried to coun@@ t the star@@ s ?
I didn &apos;t know you had a dog .
watch out for z@@ o@@ mb@@ i@@ es .
my mother is very d@@ ear to me .
don &apos;t leave me !
I o@@ we a lot of people an ap@@ o@@ lo@@ g@@ y .
he in@@ st@@ an@@ tly f@@ ell in love with her .
M@@ ir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ous@@ ly , nobody was ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly in@@ j@@ ured .
that &apos;s a good story . the only problem is that it &apos;s not true .
I &apos;m not one of them .
Tom and Mary really lo@@ ved each other .
what is it you do ?
the S@@ mi@@ th@@ s are our cou@@ sin@@ s .
C@@ am@@ bo@@ di@@ a app@@ e@@ al@@ ed to the U@@ n@@ ited N@@ a@@ tions for help .
I &apos;m from K@@ yo@@ to .
he beca@@ me a great mus@@ ic@@ i@@ an .
my house f@@ ac@@ es the se@@ a .
have you put on we@@ ight ?
W@@ a@@ x the f@@ lo@@ or .
I ap@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze if I off@@ en@@ ded you .
is this a letter ?
I thought you &apos;d be happy .
I found a r@@ are st@@ am@@ p at that stor@@ e .
I wanted to meet a really mat@@ ure woman .
can you speak Ch@@ in@@ ese well ?
as far as I know , he isn &apos;t la@@ zy .
it will be easy .
it &apos;s his sta@@ g do .
remember that .
E@@ ul@@ er &apos;s i@@ d@@ enti@@ ty really is re@@ mar@@ k@@ able .
Tom is a c@@ y@@ b@@ er@@ se@@ c@@ ur@@ ity ex@@ per@@ t .
I think Tom is con@@ f@@ used .
they were all surpri@@ sed to see me there .
take some for lat@@ er .
I can &apos;t see@@ m to find your last e @-@ ma@@ il , I won@@ der if you can re@@ s@@ end it to me .
she met the man of her d@@ rea@@ ms .
there was an ex@@ pl@@ os@@ ion .
I can ru@@ n as fast as Tom .
it &apos;s hard to ad@@ m@@ it to yourself that you are a fa@@ il@@ ure .
I &apos;m kind of slee@@ p@@ y , too .
when I g@@ row up , I want to be just like you .
they t@@ ried to swi@@ m to sa@@ fe@@ ty .
please ir@@ on the shi@@ r@@ t .
what &apos;re you looking for ?
I &apos;m a@@ w@@ are of the dang@@ er .
I think that hel@@ ps .
Tom took early re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment on heal@@ th gr@@ oun@@ ds .
I d@@ un@@ no if it &apos;s a bu@@ g or what , but this so@@ f@@ tw@@ are doesn &apos;t work right .
it pain@@ s me to dis@@ ag@@ ree with your op@@ in@@ ion .
don &apos;t you have any will po@@ wer ?
sleep is no less ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ary to heal@@ th than f@@ ood .
it &apos;s more interest@@ ing to tra@@ v@@ el alone than to go on a gr@@ ou@@ p t@@ our .
do you have enough bl@@ an@@ ke@@ ts ?
the happ@@ i@@ est wo@@ men , like the happ@@ i@@ est na@@ tions , have no hi@@ story .
the comp@@ any is in the red .
we really can make this happen .
we were very lu@@ ck@@ y .
he arri@@ ved on time in sp@@ ite of the rain .
what on ear@@ th is it ?
he al@@ most p@@ oo@@ ped his p@@ an@@ ts when he saw that sp@@ i@@ der .
are they ta@@ king good care of you ?
I think that it &apos;s going to rain so@@ on .
we lost our e@@ le@@ ct@@ ri@@ c@@ ity because of the stor@@ m .
I often bor@@ row t@@ oo@@ ls from Tom .
we were surpri@@ sed at his con@@ du@@ ct .
I &apos;m a busy person .
nobody tal@@ ks to Tom anymore .
there is no N@@ o@@ be@@ l P@@ ri@@ ze in ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ s .
I don &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I &apos;ve done it before .
Tom is comm@@ it@@ ted to ra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying the de@@ c@@ is@@ ions made by Mary .
he has seen better days .
he told me all the de@@ ta@@ il@@ s .
he is cu@@ tting down tre@@ es on a m@@ oun@@ tain .
get out of here ! all of you !
how can you be sure of that ?
Tom du@@ c@@ ked Mary &apos;s p@@ un@@ ch .
I know what you were doing .
this medi@@ c@@ ine does not have side e@@ ffe@@ c@@ ts .
I don &apos;t think you can be@@ at me .
I am cal@@ ling back my wi@@ fe .
I al@@ most believe you .
see@@ ing that you &apos;re not surpri@@ sed , I think you must have kno@@ wn .
I &apos;m a bit ho@@ ar@@ se .
could I do it ?
this book has a lot of pic@@ tu@@ res .
we took an ex@@ am@@ in@@ ation in mat@@ h last week .
Mary hel@@ ped her mother c@@ ook .

I can tell it all to my best friend .

I &apos;ve heard of you .
I didn &apos;t see him again after that .
was that what Tom said ?
he called out for help .

&quot; may I speak to M@@ r N@@ a@@ k@@ ag@@ a@@ w@@ a ? &quot; &quot; spea@@ king . &quot;

can &apos;t you en@@ h@@ ance the i@@ ma@@ ge ?
Tom p@@ us@@ hed back his c@@ hair and got up .
there are more im@@ por@@ t@@ ant things in life .
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary &apos;s last name was .
I &apos;m sure I can find something for you to do .
to believe himself in the por@@ t of N@@ ap@@ les , all that was nee@@ ded was to see the g@@ list@@ en@@ ing of k@@ ni@@ ves .
all I want is money .
we c@@ li@@ mb@@ ed right up to the to@@ p .
how long have you kno@@ wn M@@ is@@ s S@@ m@@ ith ?
the gu@@ est@@ s are all g@@ one .
an i@@ dea@@ l p@@ il@@ low is a@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able from a ma@@ il @-@ or@@ der house .
the right is on my side .
bo@@ ys are more ag@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ ve than gir@@ ls .
nothing ever makes him ang@@ ry .
she said that she would fol@@ low him no matter where he went .
you don &apos;t have the right .
my b@@ oss turned down his pro@@ pos@@ al .
I &apos;ve lear@@ ned a lot about mo@@ der@@ n au@@ th@@ or@@ s .
Tom married a much you@@ ng@@ er woman .
Tom was w@@ ear@@ ing his pa@@ j@@ a@@ ma@@ s when he op@@ ened the door .
Tom ce@@ le@@ br@@ ated his for@@ ti@@ e@@ th bir@@ th@@ day the other day , without po@@ m@@ p or cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y .
you get out only what you put in .
he is con@@ cer@@ ned about his father &apos;s il@@ l@@ ness .
I &apos;m looking for@@ ward to see@@ ing him .

the v@@ ot@@ e is un@@ an@@ im@@ ous .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him not to dri@@ ve too fast , but he w@@ ouldn &apos;t list@@ en to her .
money doesn &apos;t g@@ row on tre@@ es , you know .
I thought it difficult for her to get the ti@@ ck@@ et .
M@@ i@@ y@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ k@@ i is not what it used to be .
J@@ o@@ h@@ n &apos;s gr@@ and@@ mother p@@ as@@ sed away after a long il@@ l@@ ness .
stor@@ i@@ es often have happy en@@ d@@ ings .
together , anything is pos@@ sible .
Tom is a n@@ at@@ ur@@ al a@@ th@@ le@@ te .
they t@@ ried to dis@@ cou@@ r@@ age him from going .
there &apos;s no need to be ru@@ de .
Tom has to call his gr@@ and@@ mother .
what &apos;s the last thing you remember ?
you &apos;re not lea@@ ving until I say it &apos;s O@@ K .
keep up the good work .

no one belie@@ ved his story .
after three hours in the c@@ as@@ in@@ o , he &apos;s $ 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 in the ho@@ le .
I hi@@ d myself be@@ h@@ ind a c@@ ur@@ tain .

he had a cr@@ us@@ h on her .

have you fin@@ ished wr@@ iting that s@@ ong you &apos;ve been working on ?
I have three times more books than he has .

I think it &apos;s very li@@ k@@ ely that they &apos;ll arri@@ ve next week .
as he couldn &apos;t en@@ du@@ re , he took to his he@@ el@@ s .
the j@@ ur@@ y didn &apos;t buy D@@ an &apos;s story .
is anyone el@@ se going ?
you don &apos;t even know how .
nobody can hear you there .
the door was already op@@ en .
I love the way Tom does that .
do you have any bro@@ thers or si@@ st@@ ers ?
&quot; Mary , the co@@ ffe@@ e is too str@@ ong for me . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I am sorry . per@@ h@@ ap@@ s ad@@ d a little mil@@ k . &quot;
he made a sp@@ ee@@ ch in which he sup@@ por@@ ted my op@@ in@@ ion .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d find .
Tom ha@@ sn &apos;t re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed his mista@@ ke yet .
if you go to that su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ et , you can buy most things you use in your da@@ ily life .
let &apos;s re@@ st a little .
there was ab@@ so@@ lu@@ t@@ ely nothing you could do about it .
do you like h@@ or@@ r@@ or mo@@ vi@@ es ?
wh@@ ose turn is it ?
do you have any adv@@ ice for me ?
J@@ an@@ e is not as t@@ all as Mary .
where does J@@ o@@ h@@ n live ?
I loo@@ ked around and no@@ ti@@ ced that mine was the only car on the ro@@ ad .
I think that &apos;s the best ans@@ wer .
what f@@ oo@@ ds , if any , do you a@@ vo@@ id e@@ ating ?
I &apos;m not as busy as Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
that ar@@ ti@@ cle makes fun of v@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ ar@@ i@@ ans .
did you take the money ?
Sami re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ed the man in the p@@ ho@@ to .
we should just en@@ jo@@ y this and not wor@@ ry about how much it c@@ os@@ ts .
he &apos;s a hun@@ k .
I asked you first .
she &apos;s right be@@ h@@ ind you .
the re@@ su@@ l@@ t was ra@@ ther dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ting .
Tom didn &apos;t come to the last meeting .
by 2@@ 0@@ 3@@ 0 tw@@ en@@ ty @-@ one per@@ c@@ ent of its p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ tion will be over si@@ x@@ ty @-@ fi@@ ve .
where did you hear that story ?
I lear@@ ned how to use a ha@@ mmer from my d@@ ad .
we lost on that job .
he has a pi@@ th@@ y re@@ mar@@ k for every o@@ cc@@ as@@ ion .
she wor@@ e hear@@ t @-@ sh@@ ap@@ ed ear@@ r@@ ings .

Tom sh@@ ouldn &apos;t make fun of Mary .
he did what he promis@@ ed to do for me .
she tre@@ ated him like a king .
Tom is not cr@@ ying .

you didn &apos;t make it c@@ lea@@ r .
she &apos;s well st@@ ac@@ ked .

I spo@@ ke to him yesterday .
she &apos;s no sa@@ int .
I d@@ rea@@ m@@ ed I had been ab@@ du@@ cted by ali@@ en@@ s .
I &apos;m in way over my hea@@ d .
Tom will re@@ f@@ use to do that .
she p@@ us@@ hed him off the pi@@ er .
I don &apos;t expe@@ ct you to understand it .
give a th@@ i@@ e@@ f enough ro@@ pe and he &apos;ll han@@ g himself .
I still can &apos;t understand that .
Tom left his tru@@ mp@@ et at school .
he arri@@ ved at mi@@ d@@ night .
this looks good .
we went on a pic@@ n@@ ic together .
you &apos;re cre@@ e@@ p@@ y .
Tom often makes the same mista@@ kes .
I hear that Mary is very pre@@ tt@@ y .
I don &apos;t get it .
I went there times without nu@@ mber .
the comp@@ any man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tu@@ res a v@@ ar@@ i@@ e@@ ty of p@@ ap@@ er g@@ oo@@ ds .
you didn &apos;t have to fin@@ ish early .

I would like to be able to jo@@ in the W@@ ha@@ t@@ s@@ A@@ p@@ p G@@ r@@ ou@@ p .
my doctor ad@@ vis@@ ed me to give up smo@@ king .

Tom c@@ la@@ im@@ s to have p@@ s@@ y@@ c@@ hi@@ c po@@ w@@ ers .
he must be a good boy .
if you &apos;re not car@@ eful , you might have an acci@@ dent .
can you des@@ cri@@ be the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation you were in ?

I was off du@@ ty at the time .
the man never told the poli@@ ce what his de@@ st@@ in@@ ation was .
these are my d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters .
she sle@@ pt off her han@@ go@@ ver .
I &apos;m not used to getting up early .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m not getting fir@@ ed .
I can look into this for you .

don &apos;t read this sen@@ t@@ ence .
please don &apos;t go home .

how do you plan on pa@@ ying for that ?
we &apos;re thr@@ ough .
he was too young to go to school .
which f@@ oo@@ ds are rich in cal@@ or@@ i@@ es and which aren &apos;t ?
wait a se@@ c .
the si@@ st@@ ers are bot@@ h bl@@ on@@ d@@ es .
I &apos;ve won .
she was very ne@@ ar@@ ly ru@@ n over by a tru@@ ck .
we &apos;ve been working on this problem all wee@@ k@@ end .

I need someone who I can talk to .
the boy &apos;s ag@@ gre@@ s@@ si@@ on is ma@@ king proble@@ ms .
I don &apos;t go in for that sor@@ t of thing .
the b@@ oss doesn &apos;t know it yet .
they wal@@ ked together .
I bought her a new car .
they un@@ wr@@ app@@ ed their s@@ and@@ w@@ ic@@ h@@ es .
e@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally it was pos@@ sible to find a really sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y so@@ lu@@ tion .

heal@@ th is ab@@ o@@ ve we@@ al@@ th ; the lat@@ ter gi@@ ves less for@@ tun@@ e than the for@@ m@@ er .
your re@@ qu@@ est has been d@@ en@@ i@@ ed because you have no v@@ al@@ id re@@ si@@ d@@ enti@@ al ad@@ dress .
I did not l@@ ose my mind , I so@@ ld it on e@@ B@@ ay .
he is always a st@@ e@@ p or two a@@ hea@@ d of the times .
I can &apos;t see it .
here &apos;s the ad@@ dress .
I don &apos;t feel much like talking .

the c@@ ost of li@@ ving in@@ cre@@ as@@ ed d@@ ra@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ ally .
D@@ an had no me@@ mor@@ y of what he had done .
the C@@ a@@ th@@ ar@@ es in s@@ ou@@ th@@ er@@ n Fr@@ ance were called A@@ l@@ bi@@ gen@@ si@@ ans .
Sami was very in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent .

Sami is tal@@ l@@ er than me .

she had her dress made .
V@@ o@@ we@@ l har@@ mon@@ y is im@@ por@@ t@@ ant in the H@@ un@@ gar@@ i@@ an language .

I know where you hi@@ de your di@@ ary .
Tom said he had more im@@ por@@ t@@ ant things to do .
B@@ re@@ and@@ รก@@ n is a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
what &apos;s Tom good at ?
everything was difficult .
no one rea@@ ds my b@@ lo@@ g .
by the time he fin@@ ds out , it will be too late .
how did you l@@ ose it ?
she called him every other day .
he was late because of the s@@ now .
she said she had been happy .
how long will this go on ?
I think we &apos;re even .
I gave it my best sho@@ t .
my doctor thin@@ ks it &apos;s can@@ cer@@ ous but told me to feel free to get a se@@ con@@ d op@@ in@@ ion .
the cu@@ sto@@ ms off@@ ice is at the bor@@ der .
we took tur@@ n@@ s with the dri@@ ving .

who would better his st@@ ate should look to his f@@ oun@@ da@@ tions .
the con@@ tr@@ act was en@@ ded .

nobody can con@@ t@@ ro@@ l us .
I didn &apos;t want to in@@ su@@ l@@ t you .
where is his house ?
he had no friend to help him .
man is never per@@ fe@@ ct , no@@ r con@@ t@@ ent .
we were par@@ t@@ n@@ ers .

Tom is ol@@ der than me .

he be@@ tra@@ yed you .
Tom likes ar@@ i@@ th@@ me@@ ti@@ c .
I had no idea this br@@ ac@@ e@@ let was sto@@ le@@ n .

P@@ au@@ l tal@@ ks a lot .

Tom isn &apos;t dea@@ d .

my gr@@ and@@ mother lives in the country .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to keep it ?
our best friend is a doctor .
do c@@ ir@@ c@@ us@@ es still have f@@ rea@@ k sho@@ ws ?
my t@@ ee@@ th hur@@ t .
the bo@@ ys were as n@@ er@@ v@@ ous as the gir@@ ls .
it was the only way .
what are we sup@@ pos@@ ed to do ?
if a con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion is not going too well , try chang@@ ing t@@ ack .

you &apos;re prob@@ ab@@ ly too young to understand what &apos;s happ@@ en@@ ing .
we &apos;re not interest@@ ed .
he is her only child .
I always arri@@ ve a little a@@ hea@@ d of time .
one hun@@ dr@@ ed do@@ l@@ lar@@ s will co@@ ver all your ex@@ pen@@ ses for the tri@@ p .

free f@@ low of in@@ for@@ ma@@ tion is the only sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard ag@@ a@@ in@@ st t@@ y@@ r@@ an@@ n@@ y .
could you stay and help me ?

I &apos;d like to ask one or two questions myself .
I sha@@ ll try to take the ball without him no@@ ti@@ c@@ ing .
she wh@@ i@@ p@@ ped out her pi@@ sto@@ l .
he is not much better , and there is a little hope of re@@ co@@ very .
what you need is , in a word , pa@@ ti@@ ence .
we didn &apos;t find a we@@ ap@@ on .
make love , not wa@@ r .
any@@ body can par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate .
nobody likes him .
she &apos;d like him to leave right away .
you will always be w@@ el@@ come .
it c@@ ost a lot more than I thought it would .
I told the ne@@ ws to everyone I met .
gi@@ ven such a s@@ it@@ u@@ ation what el@@ se could I do ?
you know you &apos;ve h@@ it the big time when you get par@@ o@@ di@@ ed on T@@ he S@@ im@@ p@@ s@@ ons .

I hope to get away from T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o for a few days .
even im@@ par@@ ti@@ al@@ ity is par@@ ti@@ al .

I &apos;m already re@@ tired .
he is reading a book . let &apos;s leave him alone .
why are you looking at me ?
I &apos;m so sick of this .
Jap@@ an is here !
he turned around .

got it !
he will be waiting for you about two o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .
we were too late .
he wor@@ ks as a gh@@ ost wr@@ it@@ er .

j@@ u@@ st@@ ice in this country is a bit of a d@@ ou@@ ble st@@ and@@ ard : there is the j@@ u@@ st@@ ice of the po@@ or and the j@@ u@@ st@@ ice of the rich .

I just don &apos;t like it .
J@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ing from his app@@ ear@@ ance , he must be a rich man .
I want to ap@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to all of you for what just happened .
I never thought I &apos;d see her there .
I think we still have pl@@ en@@ ty of time .
what should we buy with this money ?
I &apos;m ma@@ king an app@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ment for my d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter .
he su@@ cc@@ ee@@ ded to his un@@ cle &apos;s for@@ tun@@ e .

A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a is about tw@@ en@@ ty times lar@@ ger than Jap@@ an .
she cu@@ t the ca@@ ke in two .
you h@@ and@@ led that well .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his su@@ cc@@ ess .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I sup@@ p@@ ose you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to s@@ it on the b@@ en@@ ch over there next to the st@@ re@@ et la@@ m@@ p .
A@@ n@@ t@@ ar@@ es is a red sta@@ r .

we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
right now , I want to speak L@@ o@@ j@@ b@@ an .
Tom drin@@ ks at le@@ ast three li@@ ters of water every day .
I &apos;ve been looking fo@@ ward to meeting you .
the thr@@ us@@ h sin@@ gs each s@@ ong tw@@ ice over .
do you know if he is a@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able ? I need to know in or@@ der to make an app@@ o@@ in@@ t@@ ment with him .
don &apos;t for@@ get about me .
we lost ag@@ a@@ in@@ st our ri@@ v@@ al on pri@@ ce .
let me buy you a drink .
if you were in my place , what would you do ?
because I speak Ch@@ in@@ ese .
have you been told the re@@ as@@ ons why we didn &apos;t hi@@ re you ?
do you watch te@@ le@@ vis@@ ion ?
I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like M@@ os@@ co@@ w ?
he &apos;s h@@ ell @-@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who k@@ illed his d@@ au@@ gh@@ ter .
that bed is very com@@ for@@ t@@ able .
the cri@@ min@@ al is sure to do time for ro@@ b@@ b@@ ing the stor@@ e .
my children are hun@@ g@@ ry .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is h@@ on@@ est .
her belie@@ f in G@@ o@@ d is very fir@@ m .
he was k@@ illed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m tel@@ ling you this .
language re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ts da@@ ily ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence .
Tom beg@@ an to shi@@ ver vi@@ ol@@ en@@ tly .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he fa@@ il@@ ed .
he should get to your house in an h@@ our .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you for@@ got to pr@@ ac@@ ti@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just fi@@ ve in the morning , but ne@@ ver@@ the@@ less it is light out .
I didn &apos;t mo@@ ve a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many ways , these f@@ os@@ s@@ il@@ s are the &apos; smo@@ king gu@@ n &apos; just before the e@@ mer@@ g@@ ence of our o@@ wn gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
how far do we have to go ?
children g@@ row very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ c@@ s , being after all a pro@@ du@@ ct of hu@@ man thought in@@ de@@ pen@@ dent of ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence , is so ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ab@@ ly ad@@ ap@@ ted to the ob@@ je@@ c@@ ts of re@@ al@@ ity ?
it &apos;s his word ag@@ a@@ in@@ st h@@ ers .
which col@@ or do you pre@@ f@@ er , b@@ lu@@ e or gre@@ en ?
the O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es cer@@ e@@ mon@@ i@@ ous@@ ly ce@@ le@@ br@@ ate the tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h of na@@ tion@@ al@@ is@@ m , do@@ ping and com@@ mer@@ ce .
in the v@@ al@@ le@@ y , the vi@@ o@@ le@@ ts came out early .
C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ l@@ and .
her sk@@ in was al@@ most tr@@ ans@@ lu@@ c@@ ent .
how could I for@@ get ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is s@@ mar@@ t .
let us sing a s@@ ong .
I had a cou@@ p@@ le of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ e@@ min@@ ine lo@@ gi@@ c is not always lo@@ g@@ ic@@ al .
when we started out , our b@@ and could only find small c@@ lu@@ b@@ s in small ci@@ ti@@ es that would hi@@ re us .
you should resp@@ e@@ ct the ru@@ les your parents s@@ et for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next wee@@ k@@ end .
I told you I have a gir@@ l@@ friend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw L@@ a@@ y@@ l@@ a hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll l@@ end it to you .
I may need to mo@@ ve on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
qu@@ it talking , will you ?
they s@@ et out for N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
I des@@ p@@ ise them .
my cat sle@@ pt next to me .
for@@ give me .
the f@@ lo@@ or is co@@ ver@@ ed with a th@@ ic@@ k car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small f@@ ar@@ m not far from B@@ os@@ ton .
an an@@ i@@ ma@@ l can be much more dang@@ er@@ ous when w@@ oun@@ ded .
can you dri@@ ve a st@@ ic@@ k shi@@ ft ?
I go to the the@@ at@@ re .
D@@ an par@@ ked the ren@@ ta@@ l car ne@@ ar the poli@@ ce sta@@ tion .
where do you want to go for our first le@@ s@@ son ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom won@@ der@@ ed why Mary had sta@@ yed in B@@ os@@ ton .
I won@@ der if there &apos;s some way of at@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting more Jap@@ an@@ ese spea@@ k@@ ers to T@@ at@@ o@@ e@@ b@@ a ?
there were no b@@ oun@@ ds to his am@@ bi@@ tion .
P@@ in@@ e@@ app@@ le is rich in c@@ it@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be hear@@ t@@ bro@@ ken .
how did it come about ?
wh@@ ose turn is it to make dinner ton@@ ight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this mo@@ vi@@ e .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lu@@ ck@@ y to be ali@@ ve .
you can dri@@ ve a car , can &apos;t you ?
as so@@ on as we got to the la@@ ke , we started swi@@ mm@@ ing .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
gi@@ ving up smo@@ king is the eas@@ i@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it th@@ ous@@ an@@ ds of times .
the dog is th@@ ir@@ st@@ y .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been pro@@ m@@ ot@@ ed to the r@@ ank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ ca@@ tion .
the f@@ ood isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you me@@ an , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no ans@@ wer .
how a@@ w@@ ful !
I ha@@ te it when my parents f@@ ight .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a str@@ ang@@ er .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to cor@@ re@@ ct those mista@@ ken as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was fi@@ ve min@@ u@@ t@@ es away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she lo@@ ved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I ple@@ ad@@ ed not gu@@ il@@ ty .
we can &apos;t pos@@ t@@ p@@ one the meeting .
you aren &apos;t inv@@ ited .
long live the g@@ er@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ ac@@ y !
she cannot play the pi@@ an@@ o .
men only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but ra@@ ther out of ab@@ s@@ ent @-@ min@@ de@@ d@@ ness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to str@@ ang@@ ers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ le@@ c@@ tion for be@@ e@@ f .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be cra@@ zy to believe such n@@ on@@ sen@@ se .
I want you to be qu@@ i@@ et .
C@@ ot@@ ton ab@@ sor@@ b@@ s water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on S@@ un@@ day .
you gu@@ ys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to c@@ ook for us ?
what language were they spea@@ king ?
never tell li@@ es .
bot@@ h al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves are pos@@ sible .
ma@@ y@@ be I should al@@ so ad@@ d sen@@ ten@@ ces without tr@@ ans@@ la@@ tions ? it is a very fast way of im@@ pro@@ ving the p@@ op@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s o@@ wn language .
do you want to be@@ t on that ?
we made s@@ ac@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en her to be my wi@@ fe .
I can &apos;t k@@ is@@ s you the way you want to be k@@ is@@ sed .
stop t@@ wi@@ st@@ ing my ar@@ m !
if he sen@@ ds me any le@@ t@@ ters , I just t@@ ear them up and th@@ row them away .
I was war@@ ned .
so@@ on@@ er or lat@@ er , Tom will li@@ k@@ ely ag@@ ree to help us .
this is lon@@ ger than any other b@@ ri@@ d@@ ge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing ?
we &apos;d like se@@ par@@ ate che@@ c@@ ks .
who w@@ ouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cr@@ os@@ sing the bor@@ der .

are you sure you &apos;re war@@ m enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my an@@ c@@ est@@ or@@ s are . our p@@ ap@@ ers got lost d@@ ur@@ ing the F@@ l@@ ood .
s@@ it down and sh@@ u@@ t up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the m@@ en@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ et .
D@@ ro@@ ple@@ ts are f@@ al@@ ling on my l@@ ap@@ to@@ p com@@ pu@@ ter .
I am sure .
I believe him to be in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a member .

smo@@ king is bad for your heal@@ th .
I@@ n@@ de@@ ed , d@@ war@@ f t@@ os@@ sing is an O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ pi@@ c sp@@ or@@ t !

I won@@ der what has be@@ come of him after he went to A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a .
I don &apos;t have much inter@@ est in c@@ oo@@ king .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ mber than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your t@@ ea@@ m .
come and keep me comp@@ any .
why are you pic@@ king a f@@ ight with me ?

it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our es@@ c@@ ap@@ e was nothing sh@@ or@@ t of a m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I sur@@ vi@@ ved .
this gl@@ ass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to cho@@ ose .
my dog has can@@ c@@ er .
do you remember the day this pic@@ ture was ta@@ ken ?
what did she do to you ?
C@@ re@@ ating T@@ at@@ o@@ e@@ b@@ a was a good idea .

I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the wh@@ o@@ le story .
you &apos;re fin@@ ished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .

only they the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves understand what they say .

everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was cr@@ ying for her mother .
they ru@@ ined it .

I really ha@@ te da@@ ir@@ y pro@@ du@@ c@@ ts .

Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .

now I am free .
who sp@@ read these ru@@ m@@ ou@@ rs ?
that was wr@@ it@@ ten by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ ag@@ a@@ w@@ a .

I know you con@@ si@@ der@@ ed me a cl@@ ose friend .

this is your fa@@ ul@@ t .
she met him on the be@@ ach .
they arri@@ ved at the ho@@ te@@ l .

haven &apos;t you e@@ at@@ en yet ?
don &apos;t talk to me about re@@ li@@ gi@@ on .

Tom is th@@ row@@ ing st@@ on@@ es at bir@@ ds .
yesterday was a good day .
Tom is a bad co@@ ach .

I &apos;m waiting for the bu@@ s .
this ru@@ g was made without the use of child l@@ ab@@ or .
de@@ ath before di@@ sh@@ on@@ or !
I o@@ il@@ ed my b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .

we want re@@ ven@@ ge .
put on your sho@@ es . let &apos;s go out for dinner .

don &apos;t even think of as@@ king me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it s@@ no@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not wr@@ iting about you .
your question is not re@@ le@@ v@@ ant to the su@@ b@@ je@@ ct .
she came to see me .
this c@@ hair is too small .
how much time do you ac@@ tu@@ ally sp@@ end thin@@ king about the fu@@ ture ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the do@@ or@@ s of per@@ ce@@ p@@ tion were c@@ le@@ an@@ sed everything would app@@ ear to man as it is , in@@ fin@@ ite .
be@@ er is my fu@@ el .
don &apos;t for@@ get to ti@@ p the por@@ ter for car@@ r@@ ying your lu@@ gg@@ age .
many great thin@@ k@@ ers who were un@@ kno@@ wn while ali@@ ve beca@@ me fam@@ ous after de@@ ath .
you &apos;re a ter@@ ri@@ ble person .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the sp@@ u@@ r of the mo@@ ment .
in N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an , &apos; d &apos; and &apos; t &apos; at the end of a word are gen@@ er@@ ally s@@ il@@ ent .
how many times do I have to tell you not to eat can@@ dy just before dinner ?
no one can do that .
I have some in@@ side in@@ for@@ ma@@ tion about the comp@@ any &apos;s pl@@ ans to go pu@@ b@@ li@@ c .
do you know the man star@@ ing at you ?
no so@@ on@@ er had he seen it than he turned p@@ al@@ e .
everyone knows we &apos;re rich .
I app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate the sen@@ ti@@ ment .
I &apos;m rich .
fin@@ ish drin@@ king your mil@@ k .
the old man di@@ ed from hun@@ ger .
2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 6 is coming to an end and a new year is about to beg@@ in !
you &apos;re the ol@@ d@@ est .
I sle@@ pt for e@@ ight hours last night .
are you here alone ?
anyone could do that .
he is good for nothing .
do you like mus@@ ic ?
take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I or@@ der@@ ed .
this is such a wa@@ st@@ e of time .
Tom is always pla@@ ying vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es .
I have been to the stor@@ e before .
stop sen@@ ding me f@@ low@@ ers .
please un@@ dress from the wa@@ ist up .
that &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me ton@@ ight ?
are you ready for the tri@@ p ?
you need to be more car@@ eful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ ster your pro@@ du@@ ct ?
D@@ an had to deci@@ de wh@@ om to believe .
you must give up smo@@ king , as it is un@@ heal@@ th@@ y .
there is a te@@ le@@ vis@@ ion in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .
I &apos;m trying to c@@ le@@ an the house .
I haven &apos;t used A@@ n@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 0@@ 0 f@@ l@@ as@@ h@@ car@@ ds du@@ e .
the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the lar@@ ge nu@@ mber of re@@ por@@ ters who had ga@@ th@@ ered ou@@ t@@ side the cou@@ r@@ th@@ ou@@ se .
I remember those days .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the ca@@ p off this bot@@ t@@ le .
I re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
A@@ l@@ th@@ ough Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is con@@ ten@@ ted .
I was bor@@ ed .
if I were heal@@ th@@ y , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that th@@ ir@@ st@@ y .
have fun with that .
there is something t@@ ro@@ pic@@ al and ex@@ o@@ ti@@ c about her which for@@ ms a sin@@ gu@@ la@@ r con@@ tr@@ ast to her c@@ ool and u@@ ne@@ mo@@ tion@@ al brother .
go there tomorrow !
nobody would list@@ en to me .
I can &apos;t pro@@ ve it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
do you have a sho@@ v@@ el I can bor@@ row ?
you have chang@@ ed since I saw you last year .
e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e , cat@@ ch a ti@@ ger by his to@@ e , if he ho@@ l@@ l@@ ers let him go , e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e . my mother told me to cat@@ ch the very best one and you are not it .
I &apos;ll go first .
how could anyone be so stu@@ p@@ id ?
there &apos;s no ex@@ it .
it &apos;s on the so@@ f@@ a .
we &apos;re looking for a place to sleep .
there &apos;s a du@@ ck on her shi@@ r@@ t .
it &apos;s easy to have a c@@ lea@@ r con@@ s@@ ci@@ ence when it &apos;s not used .
are you v@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ ar@@ i@@ an ?
if you want something to be done right , some@@ times you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the wor@@ k@@ ers are ag@@ a@@ in@@ st the new plan .
they sta@@ yed in the room with me for the wh@@ o@@ le night .
she gave me good adv@@ ice .
P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother de@@ p@@ ends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .
I want to sor@@ t this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my h@@ and , or you &apos;ll get lost .
she &apos;s str@@ ong @-@ w@@ illed .
don &apos;t ask me again .

I can &apos;t believe I did this .
the teacher con@@ f@@ is@@ c@@ ated a stu@@ dent &apos;s phone because he was t@@ ex@@ ting in cl@@ ass .
J@@ i@@ m ha@@ sn &apos;t come yet .

P@@ re@@ hi@@ stor@@ ic men were sk@@ illed in k@@ n@@ app@@ ing .

the medi@@ c@@ ine had no e@@ ffe@@ ct .
this is a book .
he doesn &apos;t get jo@@ kes .
that &apos;s not good enough for Tom .
it &apos;s a ser@@ i@@ es of tu@@ b@@ es .
Tom is here some@@ where .
Tom st@@ ood very cl@@ ose to Mary .
he re@@ ma@@ ined s@@ il@@ ent the wh@@ o@@ le time .
Tom &apos;s French pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation isn &apos;t as good as he thin@@ ks it is .
will they e@@ le@@ ct him for f@@ our more years ?
I got up too early .
since it ra@@ ined , I sta@@ yed home .
Tom put a sta@@ r on to@@ p of the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ma@@ s t@@ ree .
we &apos;re not in school anymore .
I wa@@ ke up at 7 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .

do you want some su@@ ga@@ r in your co@@ ffe@@ e ?
are you free tomorrow af@@ ter@@ no@@ on ?

you never get a se@@ con@@ d ch@@ ance to make a first im@@ pres@@ si@@ on .
he &apos;s al@@ l@@ er@@ gi@@ c to cat@@ s .
get on your k@@ ne@@ es .
is there a problem I should know about ?
D@@ an is now wanted by the poli@@ ce .
you &apos;d better tell the truth .
it was ra@@ in@@ ing hea@@ v@@ ily when I got up this morning .
I called her , but the l@@ ine was busy .
I have a co@@ at , but I don &apos;t have a h@@ at .
I can &apos;t leave off smo@@ king .

why don &apos;t I have a bo@@ y@@ friend ?
I &apos;ll talk to you lat@@ er .

I &apos;m going to jo@@ in a de@@ mon@@ st@@ ra@@ tion .
I had a good sleep last night .
come on , T@@ on@@ y .
I don &apos;t feel so sp@@ e@@ ci@@ al .
Tom is resp@@ e@@ cted by everybody .
this book is much more us@@ eful than that one .
A@@ c@@ hi@@ e@@ ving a nice w@@ el@@ d be@@ ad is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s re@@ ach !
someone sp@@ i@@ ked her drink .
if he &apos;s still ali@@ ve , he &apos;d be very old by now .

I w@@ ish I could live in a house that nice .
how long have you been di@@ v@@ or@@ ced ?
I &apos;m what the world cal@@ ls an i@@ di@@ o@@ t .
that seems like a lot .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
it &apos;s a little cold today .
he cannot speak English , much less Ger@@ man .
where ex@@ ac@@ tly do you live ?
I went to the p@@ ost off@@ ice .

I was there last night .
they who d@@ rea@@ m by day are co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ant of many things which es@@ c@@ ap@@ e those who d@@ rea@@ m only by night .
are you sure that you want to go there ?
he went back home .
this morning the wea@@ ther is cl@@ ou@@ dy .
how could you not say something ?
in all li@@ ke@@ li@@ h@@ ood , we sha@@ ll be away for a few days .
what v@@ e@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les do you us@@ u@@ ally g@@ row ?

he doesn &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
I &apos;m well a@@ w@@ are of the ri@@ s@@ k .

Tom put too much su@@ ga@@ r in my co@@ ffe@@ e .
th@@ ous@@ an@@ ds of people wanted to know the ans@@ wer .
there are some things that are difficult to tr@@ ans@@ late .
are they ta@@ king care of you ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a new car .
we want n@@ at@@ ur@@ al @-@ s@@ oun@@ ding tr@@ ans@@ la@@ tions , not word @-@ for @-@ word di@@ re@@ ct tr@@ ans@@ la@@ tions .

she will make a good wi@@ fe .
I could have pre@@ ven@@ ted this .
tra@@ v@@ el@@ ing was much more difficult in those days .
this is what I bought in S@@ p@@ ain .
I &apos;m very interest@@ ed in the e@@ vo@@ lu@@ tion of the din@@ os@@ a@@ ur@@ s .
Tom &apos;s c@@ oo@@ king .

I can &apos;t understand why you are so cri@@ ti@@ ca@@ l of him .
my b@@ rain is fri@@ ed .
you aren &apos;t in a hur@@ ry , are you ?
are you afraid of it ?
she al@@ low@@ ed him to go alone .

this man &apos;s ra@@ mb@@ l@@ ings are the f@@ ur@@ the@@ st from the truth I &apos;ve ever heard !
I can hear you l@@ ou@@ d and c@@ lea@@ r .

you must not en@@ ter the room .
the p@@ ool is fu@@ ll .
Sami did the right thing , I think .
you don &apos;t ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ar@@ ily have to go .
you have to work , not think .
we do not have enough st@@ ren@@ g@@ th to fol@@ low our re@@ as@@ on fu@@ l@@ ly .
she &apos;s always g@@ ru@@ mb@@ ling .
Tom ti@@ p@@ to@@ ed into the be@@ d@@ room to a@@ vo@@ id wa@@ king up his wi@@ fe .
feel this .
I &apos;ve f@@ al@@ le@@ n in love with you .

ma@@ y@@ be Tom will give me a job .
I know you &apos;ve got a gu@@ n .
cre@@ d@@ it car@@ ds are us@@ eful but dang@@ er@@ ous .
don &apos;t make the same mista@@ ke I did .
Tom is afraid .
cor@@ re@@ ct the fol@@ low@@ ing sen@@ ten@@ ces .
I need to ask you for a little fav@@ or .
you &apos;ll meet him tomorrow .
A@@ l@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ a is a very im@@ por@@ t@@ ant par@@ t@@ ner country for the E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ n@@ ion .

I &apos;ll find another job .

you are in par@@ t resp@@ on@@ sible for it .
this is tri@@ ck@@ y .
don &apos;t spo@@ il your app@@ e@@ ti@@ te .
I don &apos;t care how old you are .

his su@@ cc@@ ess is out of question .
she tel@@ ls him to give her all of his s@@ al@@ ary and he does .
I never w@@ in .
let &apos;s find a sa@@ fe place to hi@@ de .
I s@@ at be@@ tw@@ e@@ en Tom and J@@ o@@ h@@ n .
at that time , b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ les were just star@@ ting to get p@@ op@@ u@@ la@@ r and , here and there , there were many un@@ sk@@ illed beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers who r@@ an into people and bro@@ ke thr@@ ough their he@@ d@@ g@@ es .
please do as it seems best to you .
Tom has enough money to buy the house he wants .
the li@@ br@@ ar@@ i@@ an said we nee@@ ded to be qu@@ i@@ et .
B@@ er@@ n@@ ard of Ch@@ ar@@ tre@@ s used to say that we are like d@@ war@@ f@@ s on the sh@@ ou@@ l@@ d@@ ers of gi@@ an@@ ts , so that we can see more than they , and things at a gre@@ at@@ er di@@ st@@ ance , not by v@@ ir@@ tu@@ e of any sh@@ ar@@ p@@ ness of si@@ ght on our par@@ t , or any ph@@ y@@ sic@@ al di@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tion , but because we are car@@ ried hi@@ gh and ra@@ is@@ ed up by their gi@@ ant si@@ ze .
is it true that Tom won the r@@ ace ?
there &apos;s a bl@@ ack ho@@ le at the cen@@ ter of our g@@ al@@ a@@ x@@ y .
he com@@ es to meet me some@@ times .
a f@@ use has b@@ lo@@ wn .
I might be back before you leave .
pri@@ ces went up .
get my ri@@ f@@ le .
bo@@ ys will be bo@@ ys , gir@@ ls will be gir@@ ls .
I had some things to do .
have you ever made a pi@@ e before ?
my lea@@ ving early made them feel sorry .
you said you fi@@ g@@ ured out why .
how did that wh@@ o@@ le thing happen ?
you aren &apos;t the eas@@ i@@ est person to live with .
go up these sta@@ ir@@ s .
why do you want to di@@ e ?
Tom is hi@@ ding in the at@@ ti@@ c .
Tom has de@@ par@@ ted for A@@ u@@ str@@ ali@@ a .
we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t wa@@ st@@ e our en@@ er@@ g@@ y re@@ s@@ ou@@ r@@ ces .
I just want to be per@@ fe@@ ct .
I &apos;d like to meet Tom .
without you I am nothing .
are you trying to s@@ care me ?
you were working yesterday af@@ ter@@ no@@ on , w@@ er@@ en &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ve got to han@@ g up now . someone is waiting to use the phone .
b@@ read and mil@@ k are good f@@ oo@@ ds .
I sing the s@@ ong of him wh@@ ose b@@ read I eat .
the a@@ ir@@ por@@ t is qu@@ ite far from the c@@ ity cen@@ t@@ re .
we know that he &apos;s a b@@ ra@@ ve man .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ an U@@ n@@ ion was cre@@ ated as a re@@ su@@ l@@ t of a des@@ i@@ re to ri@@ se ab@@ o@@ ve French @-@ Ger@@ man en@@ m@@ ity .

Sami f@@ el@@ t tr@@ app@@ ed .
how could any@@ body not like this ?
go to the par@@ k .
they need him .
G@@ o@@ d is .
can I have a pi@@ z@@ z@@ a , please ?
I know where you live .
I think what you say is true .
I think we should all go to Tom &apos;s house .
that was because my watch was fi@@ ve min@@ u@@ t@@ es s@@ low .
that &apos;s only a to@@ y .
he al@@ most con@@ v@@ in@@ ced me .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m ready for this .
I we@@ i@@ gh about 6@@ 0 k@@ il@@ o@@ s .
he sa@@ ved money for the tri@@ p .
one of the pla@@ y@@ ers took off his shi@@ r@@ t .
it wasn &apos;t all that f@@ un@@ n@@ y .
I used to look up to him , but not anymore .
swi@@ mm@@ ing is easy for me .
S@@ e@@ le@@ ct ac@@ tion for Ch@@ r@@ is .
are you l@@ os@@ ing your mind ?
how was the f@@ light ?
when did I tell you that ?
by the time you got there , the su@@ n had s@@ et .
why don &apos;t I call you ?
all langu@@ ages are e@@ qu@@ al , but English is more e@@ qu@@ al than the o@@ thers .
you must take your co@@ at in c@@ ase it should be@@ come cold .
bu@@ tt@@ on your co@@ at up .
she &apos;s un@@ f@@ it for the job .
these pl@@ at@@ es aren &apos;t c@@ le@@ an .
our t@@ ea@@ m lost the first ga@@ me .
Sami was la@@ u@@ gh@@ ing about that .
she didn &apos;t want to think about it .
my Ch@@ in@@ ese did not p@@ ass .
if all el@@ se fa@@ il@@ s , re@@ boo@@ t the s@@ y@@ st@@ e@@ m .
every day I e@@ i@@ ther ri@@ de a bi@@ ke or get the bu@@ s to work .
Tom is now in j@@ a@@ il .

the door will be pain@@ ted tomorrow .
I asked Tom to wait a min@@ u@@ te .
who the fu@@ ck car@@ es ?
all the gir@@ ls la@@ u@@ gh@@ ed .
I will not see him any more .
he pic@@ ked up the book .
Tom ig@@ n@@ or@@ ed the war@@ ning .

she b@@ a@@ ked an app@@ le pi@@ e .
Tom never li@@ ked school .
he re@@ mo@@ ved his s@@ un@@ gl@@ as@@ ses .
she was a@@ ma@@ z@@ ed to hear the ne@@ ws .
if you want .
don &apos;t take any no@@ ti@@ ce of what he sa@@ ys .
can you tell me why Tom ha@@ sn &apos;t done that ?
it &apos;s si@@ mp@@ le and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive .
where do you think we came from ?
I &apos;m sorry , I couldn &apos;t hear you .
in the se@@ a , there are as many f@@ ish as you like .
